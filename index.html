            <h2><strong>Our Journey</strong></h2>
            <p>
              As Omdena Cameroon Local Chapter, we have automated land use and land cover mapping using computer vision and satellite imagery to better monitor the environment, prevent conflicts, and support long-term climate adaptation efforts in Cameroon. Through this initiative, we built a machine learning model that can classify Land Use and Land Cover categories in satellite imagery. Addionally, we've generated LULC map for Cameroon, and created a web GIS dashboard to display the results. Our open-source dataset and code are available on GitHub, and we hope that they will continue to be useful for other researchers and organizations.

            <h2>About Project</h2>
            <p>
              In light of the recent conflicts between farmers and fishermen in Cameroon, resulting in significant loss of life, injuries, and displacement, it has become crucial to address the underlying issues related to the competition for limited resources such as fisheries, pasture, and agricultural land. These conflicts have been intensified by the effects of global warming and climate change, further exacerbating tensions
            </p>
            <p>
              Furthermore, the rapid urbanization witnessed in many remote areas of Cameroon, particularly in preparation for the African Cup of Nations in 2022, has led to a surge in built-up areas and a substantial loss of terrestrial carbon storage. This loss not only contributes to carbon emissions but also poses environmental challenges, including the need for sustainable urban development and mitigating the impact on the natural ecosystem.


            </p>
            <p>
              The major cities of Douala, Yaoundé, and Bafoussam are grappling with urbanization issues caused by unregulated construction practices and settlement of populations in high-risk areas prone to disasters such as floods and landslides. Tragically, these issues have resulted in significant loss of life, with landslides claiming the lives of many individuals in Bafoussam in October 2019 and Yaoundé in November 2022.
            </p>
            <p>
              Addressing these complex challenges requires a comprehensive and data-driven approach. The Omdena Cameroon Chapter aims to leverage the power of data science and artificial intelligence to develop innovative solutions that promote sustainable land use, mitigate climate change impacts, enhance urban planning, and reduce the risk of disasters. By collaborating with experts and stakeholders, we seek to create positive social impact and contribute to a safer, more sustainable future for Cameroon and its communities.

              Whether you are an urban planner, environmental scientist, or simply curious about the land use dynamics of a specific region, our land use land cover classification feature empowers you to make informed decisions and gain a deeper understanding of the landscape. It simplifies the process of extracting valuable information from raster images and eliminates the need for manual classification efforts
